# Emilys_pies_version3
handles multi-sheets, hosted by render.com

Updated version of original Emilys Pies--for complete info please read that readme file
I wanted a separate repository for this new version since I am using a different web hosting platform--render.com
Render.com allows for direct linkage to github whereas version 2 is hosted directly on pythonanywhere. 
I did not want Render.com to confuse the repositories and I was unable to see the branch for version 3 under the main within the Render.com GUI.
So to be safe I made a new repository to link render .com to.
